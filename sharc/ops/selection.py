    Compute skeleton points using visibility-based selection method.
    
    This function selects a compact set of skeleton points from initial candidates
    based on their visibility and coverage of the surface. The selection process
    iteratively chooses points that can see uncovered surface regions while
    maintaining spatial uniformity and favoring interior points.
    
    Args:
        mesh: Input 3D mesh (trimesh or Open3D format)
        init_skeleton_points: (n, 3) array of initial candidate skeleton points.
                             If None and generate_candidates=True, will randomly 
                             sample points inside the mesh
        surface_samples: Number of points to sample on the mesh surface
        proximity_threshold: Max distance for a point to be considered "covered".
                           For models scaled to unit sphere (diameter ~2.0):
                           - 0.05-0.1: tight coverage, many skeleton points
                           - 0.1-0.2: moderate coverage (recommended)
                           - 0.2-0.5: loose coverage, fewer skeleton points
        uniformity_weight: Weight for spatial uniformity (0-1). Higher values
                          favor points that are far from already-selected points
        centrality_weight: Weight for centrality/interiority (0-1+). Higher values
                          favor points that are farther from the surface (more interior).
                          Recommended range: 0.3-1.0
        max_points: Maximum number of skeleton points to select. If None,
                   continues until all coverable points are covered
        exact_points: If True, always return exactly max_points points. Once
                     surface coverage is saturated, selection continues using
                     only the centrality/uniformity scores until max_points is
                     reached (bounded by the number of candidates). Requires
                     max_points to be set. Default False keeps the original
                     behaviour of stopping early once coverage is complete.
        random_sample_number: Number of random points to sample inside mesh 
                             if generate_candidates=True
        generate_candidates: If True and init_skeleton_points is None, will
                           randomly sample candidate points inside the mesh
        save_candidates_path: Optional path to save the initial candidate points
                             as a PLY file (e.g., "output/candidates.ply")
    
    Returns:
        Tuple containing:
            - selected_skeleton_points: (k, 3) array of selected skeleton points
            - selected_indices: (k,) array of indices into init_skeleton_points
